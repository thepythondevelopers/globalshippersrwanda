                </h2>
                <p class="text-[1rem]">ForwardMe offers package and mail forwarding services along with package consolidation services from the U.S. to other countries throughout the world. When you sign up for an account you will receive a U.S. address and suite number where you can receive your packages. When ForwardMe receives a package addressed to you, we will notify you and post the package on your ForwardMe Account landing page. After you've utilized the services available with your new account, completed the customs forms and selected your shipping, we will send the package on to your address in your home country in accordance with your instructions. ForwardMe offers three different types of accounts: A Free Account, Premium, and VIP membership with options for an annual fee or month-to-month invoicing. With a Free Account, your shipment will be sent to you in the same package that we receive. With a Premium, and VIP memberships, we can, upon your request, consolidate multiple packages into a new box, saving you substantially on your international shipping costs.</p>
